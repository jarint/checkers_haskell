# checkers_haskell
A checkers engine implemented in Haskell.

Moves.hs calculates legal moves for the engine. ApplyMove.hs applies a legal move once found. Types.hs contains some boilerplate code to deal with piece types and board state. The AI is found in JarinThundathil.hs but is missing quiesence and sometimes produces illegal moves in its current state.
